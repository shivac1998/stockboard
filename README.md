# Stockboard

## 1. Requirements Documentation

### This repository will contain the source code for a dashboard application displaying stock prices with real-time market data.

### This application will be created using React.js. Axios will be used to perform the GET request from the Alpha Vantage Stock API located here: https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=TIME_SERIES_INTRADAY&symbol=IBM&interval=5min&apikey=xxx

### Since this project has been created with no outside collaboration, the only collaborative resource that will be used in the creation of this project will be GitHub and Git for version control and management.

## 2. Architecture/Design Docs

### The goal of this application is to display market data of a variety of different stocks. The end-user should be able to type the stock ticker into a search bar to find and display a specific stock price. The arguments needed to use the API are displayed on the Alphavantage website.

## 3. End-User Docs

### The user will be able to click on each of the six displayed stocks and view pricing data from the previous day's close.

### Users can also navigate to any stock of their choosing by replacing the stock symbol in the web address when viewing a particular stock's data.
